A command line utility that talks to QuietCool wifi controllers (https://quietcoolsystems.com/products/wi-fi-smart-control/) via CoAP. The protocol was reverse engineered by observing the network communcation from the iOS app to the fans. 

# Running

Just set your CONTROLLER_IP variable to the IP address of your hub wifi controller and run the app. :+1:
