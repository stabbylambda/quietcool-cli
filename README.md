# QuietCool CLI

A command line utility that talks to QuietCool wifi controllers (https://quietcoolsystems.com/products/wi-fi-smart-control/) via CoAP. The protocol was reverse engineered by observing the network communcation from the iOS app to the fans. 

Eventually I plan to turn this into a Homebridge plugin so that I can just tell Siri or Alexa to turn on the fan instead of opening the app.
